                <p>Author: Milan Kundera <br>
                    Year: 1990 <br>
                    Plot: The novel is at times narrated by a self-insertion <br> of 
                    Kundera. At the start, this narrator sees a woman <br>wave and
                    creates the character of Agnes: "I was strangely <br>moved. And
                    then the word Agnes entered my mind. Agnes.<br> I had never 
                    known a woman by that name."<br>
                    <br>
                    Later, the Kundera character says: "A novel shouldn't be <br>like a 
                    bicycle race but a feast of many courses. I am<br> really looking to
                    Part 6. A completely new character<br> will enter the novel. And at 
                    the end of that part he will <br>disappear without a trace. He causes 
                    nothing and leaves<br> no effects. That is precisely what I like about 
                    him. Part 6 <br>will be a novel within a novel, as well as the saddest <br>
                    erotic story I have ever written."</p>
